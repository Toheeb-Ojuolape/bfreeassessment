## My Experience working on this ðŸ¤”
This was fun to build. I've had many experiences of working with Vuex and persisting with local storage so that wasn't difficult. Also, because I didn't want to spend too much time on design, I installed Vuetify to take care of the styling. I ran 3 tests, one of which was to detect if the clicked button does what it is supposed to do.

What I built is a 2 page, one component platform that does everything as requested in the brief: allows users to enter a url, generates a qr code, persists the code, stores till a maximum of 10 and then prevents new QR codes from getting generated. 

I hope you find me worthy. Looking forward to your response.

P.S I'm a huge fan of emojis and animations so I used a couple of those in my design, if you don't mind
